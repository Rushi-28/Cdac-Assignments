        <dd>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. </dd>

        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
            While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document</dd>

        <dd>ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to create user interfaces in a declarative and efficient way. It is a component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of a Model View Controller(MVC) architecture. React is used to create modular user interfaces and promotes the development of reusable UI components that display dynamic data.</dd>
