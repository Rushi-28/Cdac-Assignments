             <h1 id="opps">OOPS concepts are as follows:</h1> 
         </marquee>
     <h2>1. Class</h2>
     <h2>2.Object </h2>
     <h2>3.Method and method passing</h2>
     <h2>4.Pillars of OOPs</h2>
     
     
         <h3>    a.Abstraction</h3>
         In Java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.
     
     Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviors of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.
         <h3>b.Encapsulation</h3>
         Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
     
     encapsulation in java
     We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
     
     The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
         <h3>c.Inheritance</h3>
         Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
     
     The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
         <h3>d.Polymorphism</h3>
         Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

        <h1 id="interfacess">INTERFACE</h1>
        </marquee>
        An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class.
        <br>
        An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behavior. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.
        <br>
        <h1>Use of Interface</h1>

1. It is used to achieve total abstraction.
<br>
2. Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances.
<br>
3. Any class can extend only 1 class but can any class implement an infinite number of interface.
<br>
4. It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
<br>
5. Interfaces are used to implement abstraction.

    <h1 id="instanceofoperator">Use of Instanceof operator</h1>
</marquee>
    The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).

The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.
<br>
<br>
In Java, instanceof is a keyword used for checking if a reference variable contains a given type of object reference or not. Following is a Java program to show different behaviors of instanceof. Henceforth it is known as a comparison operator where the instance is getting compared to type returning boolean true or false as in Java we do not have 0 and 1 boolean return types.

<h1>Application of Java instanceof keyword</h1>
We have seen here that a parent class data member is accessed when a reference of parent type refers to a child object. We can access child data members using typecasting. 

Syntax
((child_class_name) Parent_Reference_variable).func.name()
When we do typecasting, it is always a good idea to check if the typecasting is valid or not. instanceof helps us here. We can always first check for validity using instanceof, then do typecasting.

    <h1 id="ExceptionHandling">Exception Handling</h1>
</marquee>
    The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.

In this tutorial, we will learn about Java exceptions, it's types, and the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions

<h2>What is Exception handling?</h2>
    Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.
    <h2>Advantage of Exception Handling</h2>
    The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application. An exception normally disrupts the normal flow of the application; that is why we need to handle exceptions.
