        <h1>Data structure in java </h1>
</div>
    <h2 style="background-color: brown;color: white;text-align: center;" id="stack">Stack</h2>
    <p>Java Collection framework provides a Stack class that models and implements a Stack data structure. The class is based on the basic principle of <span style="color:chartreuse;background-color: black;">last-in-first-out</span>. In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more functions of <b>empty, search, and peek.</b> The class can also be said to extend Vector and treats the class as a stack with the five mentioned functions. The class can also be referred to as the subclass of Vector.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color: brown;color: white;text-align: center;" id="array">Array</h2>
    
    <p>Array in Java is a group of like-typed variables referred to by a <span style="color:chartreuse;">common name.</span> Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++. Following are some important points about Java arrays. 

        In Java, all arrays are dynamically allocated. (discussed below)
        Arrays may be stored in contiguous memory [consecutive memory locations].
        Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using the object property length. This is different from C/C++, where we find length using sizeof.
        A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.
        The variables in the array are ordered, and each has an index beginning with 0.
        Java array can also be used as a static field, a local variable, or a method parameter.
        The size of an array must be specified by int or short value and not long.
        The direct superclass of an array type is Object.
        Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable. 
        This storage of arrays helps us randomly access the elements of an array [Support Random Access].
        The size of the array cannot be altered(once initialized).  However, an array reference can be made to point to another array.</p>

        <h2 style="background-color:brown;color: white;text-align: center;" id="queue">Queue</h2>
       
        <p>1. A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables 
            <b>insert operations to be performed at one end called <span style="color:chartreuse;">REAR </span></b>and <b>delete operations to be performed at another end called <span style="color:chartreuse;">FRONT.</span></b>
            <br>
            2. Queue is referred to be as First In First Out list.
            <br>
            3. For example, people waiting in line for a rail ticket form a queue.
            
            
            ds Queue
            Applications of Queue
            Due to the fact that queue performs actions on first in first out basis which is quite fair for the ordering of actions. <br> There are various applications of queues discussed as below.
            
            Queues are widely used as waiting lists for a single shared resource like printer, disk, CPU.
            Queues are used in asynchronous transfer of data (where data is not being transferred at the same rate between two processes) for eg. pipes, file IO, sockets.
            Queues are used as buffers in most of the applications like MP3 media player, CD player, etc.
            Queue are used to maintain the play list in media players in order to add and remove the songs from the play-list.
            Queues are used in operating systems for handling interrupts.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:brown;color: white;text-align: center;" id="list">List</h2>
            <p>List in Java provides the facility to maintain the ordered collection. It contains the <b>index-based methods</b> to insert, update, delete and search the elements. It can have the duplicate elements also. We can also store the null elements in the list.

                The List interface is found in the <b>java.util package and inherits the Collection interface.</b> It is a factory of ListIterator interface. Through the ListIterator, we can iterate the list in forward and backward directions. <b>implementation classes of List interface are ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack and Vector</b>The . The ArrayList and LinkedList are widely used in Java programming. The Vector class is deprecated since Java 5.</p>

                <h2 style="background-color:brown;color: white;text-align: center;" id="dll">Doubly LinkedList</h2>
                <p>In a doubly linked list, each node contains <span style="color: chartreuse;">three data members:</span>
                    <br>
                    <b>data:</b> The data stored in the node <br>
                    <b>next:</b> It refers to the reference to the next node <br>
                    <b>prev:</b> It refers to the reference to the previous node <br>
                    Creation of <b>Doubly Linked Lists</b> in Java: <br>
                    To create a doubly linked list, first, we need to define a Node class that has three data members that will store the data stored in the node, the reference to the next node, and the reference to the previous node.</p>
