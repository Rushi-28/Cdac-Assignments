        An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class.
        <br>
        An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behavior. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.

        <h1>Use of Interface</h1>

1. It is used to achieve total abstraction.
<br>
2. Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances.
<br>
3. Any class can extend only 1 class but can any class implement an infinite number of interface.
<br>
4. It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
<br>
5. Interfaces are used to implement abstraction.
