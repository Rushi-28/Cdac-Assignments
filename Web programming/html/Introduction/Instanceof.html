    <h1>Use of Instanceof operator</h1>
    The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).

The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.

In Java, instanceof is a keyword used for checking if a reference variable contains a given type of object reference or not. Following is a Java program to show different behaviors of instanceof. Henceforth it is known as a comparison operator where the instance is getting compared to type returning boolean true or false as in Java we do not have 0 and 1 boolean return types.

<h1>Application of Java instanceof keyword</h1>
We have seen here that a parent class data member is accessed when a reference of parent type refers to a child object. We can access child data members using typecasting. 

Syntax
((child_class_name) Parent_Reference_variable).func.name()
When we do typecasting, it is always a good idea to check if the typecasting is valid or not. instanceof helps us here. We can always first check for validity using instanceof, then do typecasting.
